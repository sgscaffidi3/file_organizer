## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use Github to report security vulnerabilities 

Note: Security is not a top-priority for a FOSS tool developed as a hobby.
      That said, I will take all serious reports of security issue seriously,
      so please report. Always try to use the latest versions of all external
      libraries and pre-requisates, and report any compatibility issues.
      Thank you.
